            <p>
              These Terms govern your use of Dr. Appliances Repairs' website and services. By requesting a quote
              or booking an appointment you accept these Terms.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">2. Services & Fees</h2>
            <p>
              We dispatch a technician to inspect the appliance for a diagnostic fee of $100. After inspection we
              provide a written quote for parts and labor. The diagnostic fee is payable whether or not you accept
              the repair quote.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">3. Payment & Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              Payment for diagnostic, parts, and labor is due as specified on the invoice. Special-order parts are
              non-refundable. We do not store full payment card details; third-party processors handle payments.

              Appointments are scheduled by mutual agreement. Cancel or reschedule at least 24 hours before the visit
              to avoid additional fees. We may reschedule for operational reasons.
